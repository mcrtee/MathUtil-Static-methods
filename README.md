# MathUtil

## Overview
The `MathUtil` class provides a collection of static and non-static methods for performing various mathematical operations, including prime checking, greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), Fibonacci sequence calculation, and more. It serves as a utility for both basic and advanced mathematical computations.

## Features
- **Static Methods**:
  - `isPrime(int n)`: Checks if a number is prime.
  - `gcd(int a, int b)`: Computes the greatest common divisor.
  - `lcm(int a, int b)`: Calculates the least common multiple.
  - `fibonacci(int n)`: Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
  - `factorial(int n)`: Computes the factorial of a number.

- **Non-Static Methods**:
  - `isPerfectNumber(int n)`: Checks if a number is perfect.
  - `sumOfDigits(int n)`: Computes the sum of the digits of a number.
  - `reverseNumber(int n)`: Reverses the digits of a number.
  - `isArmstrongNumber(int n)`: Checks if a number is an Armstrong number.
  - `nextPrime(int n)`: Finds the smallest prime number greater than n.

## Installation
To use the `MathUtil` class, clone the repository and include the Java files in your project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MathUtil.git
cd MathUtil
